# Voice Command to Serial Communication

This Python script captures voice commands using a microphone, processes them into text via the Google Speech Recognition API, and sends the recognized text to a device over a serial connection. The script is ideal for integrating voice commands into hardware projects, such as controlling a Micro:bit.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

- Python 3.6 or newer
- Required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pyserial sounddevice SpeechRecognition
  ```

- Hardware:
  - Microphone
  - Device with serial communication support (e.g., Micro:bit).

## Setup

1. **Connect Your Device**:  
   Connect your device to your computer and note the serial port name (e.g., `COM15` for Windows or `/dev/ttyUSB0` for Linux/Mac).

2. **Adjust Serial Port**:  
   Update the line:
   ```python
   ser = serial.Serial('COM15', 115200)
   ```
   Replace `'COM15'` with your device's serial port.

## Running the Script

1. **Ambient Noise Adjustment**:  
   The script automatically adjusts for background noise before capturing voice input.

2. **Execute the Script**:  
   Run the script:
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

3. **Speak a Command**:  
   Speak into the microphone. The recognized text is sent to the device via serial communication.

4. **Keyboard Interrupt**:  
   Press `Ctrl + C` to terminate the script.

## Error Handling

- **UnknownValueError**: Triggered when the script cannot understand the audio input.
- **RequestError**: Occurs if thereâ€™s an issue with the Google Speech Recognition API.

## Notes

- Ensure your microphone is properly configured and accessible to the script.
- For Linux/Mac users, adjust the serial port name as needed.
- The script may require an internet connection for the Speech Recognition API.
